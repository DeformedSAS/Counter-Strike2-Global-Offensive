- You are required to use HLAE!
- HLAE panorama loader [panorama.my.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17939965/panorama.my.zip)

# How to install?
- Download HLAE First. Run HLAE, paste the panorama zip file linked above into %appdata%\hlae
- Download the cs2go zip file from releases tab and extract it where csgo.exe is
- In HLAE go to Tools > Developer > Custom Loader and find your CS:GO install. Then paste these launch options: -language cs2panorama -game cs2go/csgo -afxdetourpanorama
